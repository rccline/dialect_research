MLA International Bibliography,mzh,2.02434E+11,Language Change in Real- and Apparent-Time: Coherence in the Individual and the Community,"This book makes the case for the value of a combined panel and trend study approach in studying real- and apparent-time language change to reconcile conspicuous disparities between the individual and the community. Through an examination of the Swabian dialect in southwestern Germany in two speech communities over four decades, this volume resolves critical methodological challenges in investigating lifespan and community change. This work affirms the importance of the speech community in shaping change and demonstrating how speakers’ notions of local identity and community belonging inform their choice of linguistic variants. Drawing on a comprehensive, integrated methodology, this research brings together diverse approaches for measuring changing social constructs and analyzing linguistic structures using state-of-the-art statistical methods bolstered by participant-observer and ethnographic observations. Beaman explores indexicalities of identity, accommodation, and geographic mobility to investigate how predictable sociolinguistic patterns promote variation and influence language change. Empirically, this volume documents processes of dialect leveling and supraregionalization and the emergence of a “Swabian Renaissance” among younger, well-educated urban speakers who leverage the social indexical status of certain linguistic variables to convey social meanings of local prestige and community belonging. Methodologically, this book offers best practices from a combined panel and trend study, demonstrating the compatibility and complementarity of real- and apparent-time analyses in uncovering the nature, rate, and dispersion of linguistic change. Theoretically, this work links intraspeaker lifespan change and interspeaker community change into a holistic approach, pushing forward our understanding of the role that “orderly heterogeneity” plays in language variation and change. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, dialectology, and historical linguistics.",20240101,"Beaman, Karen V.",Book,Book,2024,,,German language (New High) ; Swabian German dialect ; language change ; sociolinguistic variation ; speech community ; ethnographic approach,BOOK,,978-1-00-326733-1 ; 978-1-03-221216-6,,,,,,eng,Routledge,,,,,,10.4324/9781003267331,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=7faaf547-4140-3a72-8582-0ab02a454513

MLA International Bibliography,mzh,2016930861,A Sociolinguistic Study of Bitburger Platt German,"Bitburger Platt, spoken in the Eifel region of western Germany, exhibits a merger of the Standard German (d) and (t) sounds, the reflexes of West Germanic th and d, respectively. A chain shift yielded the modern Standard German variants. Biburger Platt, however, did not follow through with the first phase of this shift; rather, the two sounds were merged into [d] in the dialect (Veith, 1999). As an example, the Standard German phrase +du tust= 'you do (cognate to English thou doest)' is realized in Bitburger Platt as [dou depsilonjs]. Bitburg is a town where many (if not most) residents are undergoing or have recently undergone a transition from a home-based, agrarian lifestyle to one requiring a commute to an urban center and more contact with nonlocals. Such a transition has been shown by other studies (Hofmann, 1963, Besch, 1981, Lenz, 2003) to go hand-in-hand with language shift, specifically a shift from the use of base dialects (basilects) to regional colloquial varieties that lie on a continuum between the base dialect and the standard and exhibit features of both. The effects of situational and social factors on one's language use have long been attested. Labov (1963, 1966) mainstreamed the discipline of studying such variation in language, but others before his time showed awareness of it as well (Vietor, 1875, Wegener, 1891). A sociolinguistic study can reveal much about a particular speech community, ranging from qualitative information on the community's attitudes toward their language to quantifiable data that reveal how the individual community members actually speak. This study focuses heavily on the latter, specifically investigating correlations between participants' age, gender, and recording situation and their articulation of the alveolar stop consonants (d) and (t). Participants first took part in recorded interviews with me, and then in a conversation with a close friend or family member, during which I was not present. Their recordings were subsequently searched for all tokens with Standard German (d) and (t) correspondences in initial and medial position. Those tokens in initial position underwent analysis for voice onset time (VOT) and harmonic difference (H1-H2), both proven to be acoustic correlates to fortis/lenis contrasts (Lisker and Abramson, 1964, Jessen, 1996). Medial tokens underwent analysis for the parameter of closure duration, also shown to be a fortis/lenis correlate. Results indicate that participants show an overwhelming preference for merged variants in conversational speech - the indicator of dialecticity. In interview speech, however, the fortis/lenis contrast is maintained by all but the older men, a likely consequence of changing linguistic norms in the community.",20160801,"Pischnotte, Zebulon Aaron",Dissertation Abstract,Dissertation Abstract,2016 Aug,FALSE,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global,German language (New High) ; phonetics ; acoustic phonetics ; Bitburg ; fortis/lenis opposition ; alveolar stop consonants ; sociolinguistic approach ; dissertation abstract,THES,,,,,,,,eng,University of Utah,,,,77,2,,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=f98b301c-b7ad-3314-b41e-6d82aefb4840

During his stay, several German authors described the two varieties of Cantonese spoken by him and his fellow traveler, Fung Asseng, a native of Xiāngshān.

This essay, however, compares the revaluation of the term Kanake, a non-assimilatory Kanak identity, and the ethnolect Kanak Sprak to some early 20th century German Jews' revaluation and embrace of Eastern European Jewish culture and Yiddish. It demonstrates also how non-minority and non-Jewish Germans have used Yiddish and Kanak Sprak in literature, theater, film, and popular culture to re-inscribe ethnic difference, especially at times when minorities and Jews were becoming indistinguishable from non-minority Germans (emancipation edicts or nationality law reform). Because Kanak Sprak is inseparable from HipHop culture, the second half of the essay examines the many parallels between the importation and naturalization of German HipHop and German Klezmer. Both were imported from the United States in the early 1980s; and following the fall of the Berlin Wall and German re-unification, both have played a role in German Vergangenheitsbewältigung [mastering the past]. While HipHop and Klezmer have become the soundtrack of German anti-racism, anti-Nazism, and multiculturalism; some observers are critical of non-minority and non-Jewish Germans' appropriation or instrumentalization of ethnic music, and have cited instances of antisemitism and racism in German Klezmer and HipHop.",20060901,"Loentz, Elizabeth",Journal Article,Journal Article,2006 Fall,TRUE,Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies,German language (New High) ; stylistics ; social dialects ; ethnolinguistic minorities ; folk literature ; folk poetry ; folk song ; rap song ; Turkish Germans ; Germany ; ethnic identity ; klezmer music,JOUR,,,1534-5165 ; 0882-8539,,,,,eng,Purdue University Press,62,33,30,25,1,10.1353/sho.2006.0134,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=3222db47-55b5-38fa-af29-cdff1f4f0933

MLA International Bibliography,mzh,2.02227E+11,Regional Language Variation in the German Curriculum,"German is a pluricentric language with many standard and nonstandard varieties. Students of German are usually unaware of its rich regional variation, and studies attribute this to limited resources and instructional time (van Kerckvoorde, 2012). The “DACH” model of teaching German, which includes linguistic and cultural elements from Germany (D), Austria (A), and Switzerland (CH), has constituted an effort to go somewhat beyond a model that exclusively teaches Standard German, from Germany. However, when not contextualized properly, DACH itself oversimplifies language variation, shifting the attention from one standard version of German to three. This article proposes that German's variation should be taught to students at all levels and may be considered in the framework of the ACTFL Guidelines and Standards. These strongly support learners' successful functioning in real‐world and authentic situations, including in dealing with varying dialects. This article will offer an overview of German language variation, it will outline how its integration is aligned with the ACTFL Guidelines (2012), and it will discuss some current instructional challenges. Finally, it will offer concrete examples for instructors by using existing sections from popular college German textbooks and by presenting several worksheets on dialect teaching for the novice, intermediate, and advanced levels.",20220901,"Pittman, Iulia",Journal Article,Journal Article,2022 Fall,TRUE,Die Unterrichtspraxis/Teaching German,teaching of language ; curriculum ; teaching approaches (language) ; German language teaching ; standard language ; linguistic variation ; regional differences,JOUR,,,1756-1221 ; 0042-062X,,,,,eng,American Association of Teachers of German,221,206,16,55,2,10.1111/tger.12210,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=a4264a31-5744-35e7-820d-ab62f74599d5

Based on the research carried out in the Upper Sorbian Grammar School in Bautzen/Budyšin (Germany) combining a statistical survey, in-depth interviews with pupils and participant observation of pupils language practices, this paper discusses the case study of a school with a three-type education programme of Upper Sorbian language: immersion, bilingual, and teaching it as a foreign language. The paper contributes to the discussion on the effectiveness of bilingual and foreign minority language learning in a situation of unequal bilingualism in a territory inhabited by a small minority language community. The text presents these problems from the German-speaking pupils’ viewpoint and concerns: the teaching methods and their effectiveness; possible language contacts as a factor of acquiring a minority language; attitudes of native pupils and teachers to learners; the ideology of language ownership and speakers legitimisation. These aspects are presented in the context of different types of minority language speakers: ‘learners’, ‘new speakers’ and ‘native speakers’ and is presented against the background of the discussion on minority language education in the process of Upper Sorbian language revitalisation.",20210401,"Dołowy-Rybińska, Nicole",Journal Article,Journal Article,2021 Apr,TRUE,International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism,Sorbian language ; Upper Sorbian dialect ; educational policy ; language revival ; bilingualism ; language attitudes ; German language (New High),JOUR,,,1747-7522 ; 1367-0050,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis,514,500,15,24,4,10.1080/13670050.2018.1486803,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=ad68a81c-ad89-31af-867a-0439ef62d62b
MLA International Bibliography,mzh,2.02123E+11,The View from Within: Gendered Language Ideologies of Multilingual Speakers in Contemporary Berlin,"Drawing on interview data on Kiezdeutsch, we argue that a focus on gendered language ideologies is much needed to understand the social meanings ascribed to multiethnolectal practices. By attuning carefully to the nuanced, subjective ideological stances of young multilingual women, we show that at the interactional level, Kiezdeutsch is constructed as a consequence of the interviewees' multilingual practice and thus activates a sense of belonging and entitlement. At the macro level, however, the belonging to a multilingual speech community is tied up with the representation of a racialized and ethnicized ‘other’ in the mainstream, dominant public discourse prevalent in Germany. As young males are the more salient figure in the construction this racialized and ethnicized ‘other’, Kiezdeutsch then becomes indexed with masculinity—even within the peer group. Saying that Kiezdeutsch is used among friends thus presents only a partial picture on how, for girls and young women, using Kiezdeutsch becomes socially sanctioned both in the public sphere and in private settings.Anhand von Interviewdaten zu Kiezdeutsch zeigen wir, dass ein genauerer Blick auf der Gender‐Dimension von Sprachideologien dringend erforderlich ist, um die sozialen Bedeutungen zu verstehen, die mit multiethnolektalen Praktiken verbunden sind. Anhand der Analyse nuancierter, subjektiver Sprachideologien junger Frauen wird gezeigt, dass Kiezdeutsch auf der Interaktionsebene als Folge der mehrsprachigen Praxis der Befragten konstruiert wird und somit ein Gefühl der Zugehörigkeit und der Berechtigung entsteht. Auf der Makroebene ist die Zugehörigkeit zu einer mehrsprachigen Sprachgemeinschaft jedoch mit der Repräsentation eines rassifizierten und ethnisierten ‘Anderen’ im öffentlichen Mainstream‐Diskurs verknüpft. Da junge Männer in der Konstruktion dieses rassifizierten und ethnisierten ‘Anderen’ die hervorstechendste Figur sind, wird Kiezdeutsch mit Männlichkeit indiziert—und dies auch innerhalb der Peer‐Group. Die Annahme, dass Kiezdeutsch im Freundeskreis verwendet wird, gibt also nur ein unvollständiges Bild davon wieder, wie die Verwendung des Multiethnolekts für Mädchen und junge Frauen sowohl im öffentlichen als auch im privaten Bereich sozial sanktioniert wird.",20210601,"Truan, Naomi ; Oldani, Martina",Journal Article,Journal Article,2021 June,TRUE,Journal of Sociolinguistics,German language (New High) ; dialectology ; social dialects ; multilinguals ; gender,JOUR,,,1467-9841 ; 1360-6441,,,,,eng,Wiley-Blackwell,397,374,24,25,3,10.1111/josl.12471,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=4f481ef9-4a3b-379f-8dad-370f997c9903

It was colonized by the Carinthian counts of Ortenburg in the 14th century with settlers from Carinthia and Tyrol. The original German settlers were speaking a Bavarian dialect that was influenced during the centuries by Slovenian dialects. The ethnolinguistic enclave is of special interest in terms of its size and population, its changing political affiliations, its resettlement in 1941/1942 in a nearby area of Slovenian settlers. At the end of the war, the Gottscheers were forced to flee to Austria. Some of the refugees eventually found new homes in Austria and Germany, however, most immigrated to the United States and Canada, where they had friends and relatives who had immigrated to those countries prior to World War II.

The paper describes Swabian subject use as it emerges from the corpus data with regard to morphological form, syntactic distribution, reference and informational status. Swabian, unlike Standard German, allows and in some cases prefers clause-internal referential subjects to be null, whilst in other contexts, referential null subjects are ruled out. There is a robust second person null-subject property, with 61% of 2nd singular subject pronouns being dropped clause-internally, i.e. from a position following the finite verb in main clauses or following a complementiser in embedded clauses. 1st singular and 3rd singular neuter subjects are dropped clause-internally as well, but at much lower frequencies and only in very specific phonological and lexical constellations, not previously noted in the literature.

By ‘contrastive bipolar scale’ we have in mind a scale with two different, explicit ‘options’ (here words), one at each end. We analyse a large-scale rating study consisting of nearly 1,000 participants and almost 700 pairs of word items per participant. A pair consisted of two synonymous words from a non-standard Silesian variety, one of German origin (a loan), one from the Polish Standard language. The judgement to be given was an estimation of the subjective frequency of the use of the German loan in comparison to its Polish equivalent in colloquial Silesian speech. We use non-linear regression analysis, GAMM, to examine if the presentation order of words affects the mean ratings. Findings show that results are not affected by either the high number of test items or the order of the presentation of word items.",20210101,"Fekete, István ; Hentschel, Gerd",Journal Article,Journal Article,2021 Jan,TRUE,Journal of Quantitative Linguistics,Polish language ; Silesian Polish dialect ; lexicology ; word borrowing ; German language (New High) ; questionnaires ; word choice ; word frequency ; regression analysis,JOUR,,,1744-5035 ; 0929-6174,,,,,eng,Taylor & Francis,38,20,19,28,1,10.1080/09296174.2019.1617091,,,,https://research.ebsco.com/linkprocessor/plink?id=62fa4165-244b-3a5d-b0b4-093c8326cf27

The variable, which is approached from a philological-lexicographic as well as a quantitative-statistical perspective, is interpreted in the light of recent European cross-borders studies. Analogues with the situations in Austrian German (Austria-Germany) and British English (Scotland-England) are drawn. Set in a pluricentric framework, this paper argues that the Canada-US border remains a productive linguistic divide.

Special, over-proportional emphasis was put on collecting the full range of the Volkskunde canon and conducting dialect studies, by professionally trained folklorists, dialectologists, photographers, and filmmakers. For the Nazi 'scholars' - many of whom were SS - the underlying assumption was that these were survivals of ancient Germanic traditions and language. Arguably, it is one of the largest folklore/linguistic field investigations in history. This present study addresses one particular aspect of this enormous undertaking: the underlying ideology, the search for Nordic sources in South Tyrol.
